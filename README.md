**DO NOT COPY MY SKINS PLEASE! If you wish on inspo, ASK! MY ONLY EXCEPTION ON INSPIRATION ARE MY ZERAORA COSPLAYS.**

**If I'm doing something wrong out in public, PLEASE TELL ME! I dislike making people uncomfy and people hiding me for unsaid reason.Talking to me in a calm manner's best for curing me of moody actions, as they usually always are, not to mention I wish for no one to be feeling bad.**

Heya there. The name's Kittspi (Kitt-SPEE). I also go by Kitters or Zera.

If ya seein' all of this, then you saw it on a special skin I must have on PT (Pony Town), or saw it as a link in my Patreon. I'm trying to figure out what to put on here separate from my Patreon so this is a WIP.

______________________________

Wanna know a quick summary of me? Well, my pronouns are She/Her preferably, but They/Them's okay. Close people call me Kitt and Kittkat's my special name. I'm a furry, and I admire Pokemon! 

I dislike copying/taking hard inspo. Vice versa as well. But if I end up having a similar morph/skin similar to any of yours, varying on mood, then I could change its design. No harm done.

I Also Tag My Patreon, Discord, And/Or Github On Certain Skins for Certain Reasons!

Patreon: Usually Tagged With My Top Skins, Or For People To Get To Know Me Directly Upon Clicking.

Github: Usually Less Detailed Skins. (I'm Not Fully Sure What To Keep On My Github As Of Right Now, This Is A WIP!)

Discord: Less Detailed Skins OR Showing For Friend Requests (subtle). -- My Discord's Zera! [Kittspi]#6109
