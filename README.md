Heya there. The name's Kittspi (Kitt-SPEE). I also go by Kitters or Zera.

If ya seein' all of this, then you saw it on a special skin I must have on PT (Pony Town), or saw it as a link in my Patreon. I'm trying to figure out what to put on here separate from my Patreon so this is a WIP.

______________________________

Wanna know a quick summary of me? Well, my pronouns are She/Her preferably, but They/Them's okay. Close people call me Kitt and Kittkat's my special name. I'm a furry, and I admire Pokemon! 

I dislike copying/taking hard inspo. Vice versa as well. But if I end up having a similar morph/skin similar to any of yours, varying on mood, then I could change its design. No harm done.
