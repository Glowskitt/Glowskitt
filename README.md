Heya there. The name's Kittspi (Kitt-SPEE). I also go by Kitters or Zera.

I literally have no reason to make this, so take this as a TL;DR. üíÄ

______________________________

Wanna know a quick summary of me? Bet.

I go by the names Kitt, Kittster, Kittsora, Zera, Kitters, Klouded/Kloudy(?), Glowskitt/Glowspee, and Kittkat. Yeah, lotta "Kitts", ain't there. Closest friends can call me Korryn.

I dislike copying/taking hard inspo. Vice versa as well. But if I end up having a similar morph/skin similar to any of yours, varying on mood, then I could change its design. No harm done.

Fandom interests (most of which I don't really know a lot about)

.‚òÅÔ∏è. Pokemon

.‚òÅÔ∏è. Murder Drones! (Fans INT Pleasepelaepapelapslp

.‚òÅÔ∏è. FNAF 

!!! **HEY! I Don't Like Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss In Any Association With The Creator Vivziepop. I Only Love Two or Three Characters, With ZERO Relation To Dreaded Ties On Viv. I HATE The Fandom. S/A Jokers and Valentino IRLs DNI. I'm A Victim Myself And You're Mocking Me In Front Of My Peripheral Vision.
