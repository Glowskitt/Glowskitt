Heya there. The name's Kittspi (Kitt-SPEE). I also go by Kitters or Zera.

If ya seein' all of this, then you saw it on a special skin I must have on PT (Pony Town), or saw it as a link in my Patreon.


***The REASON you're seeing this GitHub is because it explains that I'm not feeling okay at that moment. For the last 4 months (since this creation of my GitHub) and further on, I've been dealing with minor harassment and false-accusations. I also have PTSD from two semi-similar traumas. All I ask is that you don't come complaining to me over anything I do or say to accidentally upset you and just tell me what I'm doing wrong. Be mature and civilized about it.***
