Heya there. The name's Kittspi. (Kitt-SPEE)

If ya seein' all of this, then you saw it on a special skin I must have on PT (Pony Town). When there's a skin tagged with my GitHub on it, it mean's I'm not feeling all that good.


***The REASON you're seeing this GitHub is because it explains the situation I'm in. Ex-friends who I no longer see as people I would give two fucks about are draining me an my friend(s). For the last 4 months (since this creation of my GitHub) and further on, I've been dealing with minor harassment and false-accusations. If you see me standing over the Patreon "StickmanProbably", it's because I have them hidden. All I ask from those who see this is to give me a break on any bullcrap like calling my friend a pedophile or harassing him. Like literally, shut the fuck up.***
