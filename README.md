Heya there. The name's Kittspi. (Kitt-SPEE)

If ya seein' all of this, then you saw it on a special skin I must have on PT (Pony Town).Well... To begin with, those tagged with a GitHub tag is rare. I have a few skins with that; at the moment, they are:

Zoroarks (regu. + shiny). I usually deal drama with this skin. I'm a drama fan, meaning I love to call a drama starter insane for being a zoo, pedo, etc.
Zeraora (Fluffed Up, C+H). Could be comforting a person/friend affected by drama. Yea, unlike most dicks, I care.
Gift skins. I care about these with all my heart.
The REASON you're seeing this GitHub is because it explains the situation I'm in. Ex-friends who I no longer see as people I would give two fucks about are draining me an my friend(s). For the last 4 months (since this creation of my GitHub) and further on, I've been dealing with minor harassment and false-accusations. If you see me standing over the Patreon "StickmanProbably", it's because I have them hidden. All I ask from those who see this is to give me a break on any bullcrap like calling my friend a pedophile or harassing him. Like literally, shut the fuck up.

Wanna know a quick summary of me? Well, my pronouns are She/Her preferably, but They/Them's okay. My names are Kittspi/Kitters/Kat/Wolfsvi/Wolfers.
